HGBUNDLER INSTALL
=================

Dependencies
============

  - lxml (recommended) or elementtree:
    This is in all major linux distributions. Debian example::
         aptitude install python-lxml

  - tidy:
    This is for the pretty dumping of the manifest at the end of the
    release-bundle process. This is in all major linux distributions.
    Debian example::
         aptitude install tidy

  - Pure python dependencies are managed by zc.buildout. Therefore you
    need setuptools/distribute


============
Installation
============

Buildout sandbox
================

Run::
 python bootstrap.py
 bin/buildout

You'll find the produced relocatable scripts in the `bin` subdirectory.
They usually work on the current directory, so you'll have to
put them on your PATH somehow, for example::
 export PATH=~/hg.cps-cms.org/hgutils/bin:$PATH
and you are ready to use the hgutils executables: `hgbundler`, `hgmap`, etc.

Buildout sandbox in a virtualenv
================================

.. _virtualenv: http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html

Normally one should have no problem building hgutils with the buildout sandbox
procedure depicted above.

But there appears to be some sandbox violation problems when building in some
cases not clearly identified yet. The following happens for example on Debian
GNU/Linux 6.0 (squeeze)::

 ~/hg.cps-cms.org/hgutils$ python bootstrap.py
 install_dir /tmp/tmpasm532
 Getting distribution for 'distribute==0.6.16'.
 install_dir ~/hg.cps-cms.org/hgutils/eggs/tmpzPYIR_
 Before install bootstrap.

 Non-egg installation

 After install bootstrap.

 error:
 /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg-info:

 An error occurred when trying to install distribute 0.6.16. Look above
 this message for any errors that were output by easy_install.
 While:
   Bootstrapping.
     Getting distribution for 'distribute==0.6.16'.
     Error: Couldn't install: distribute 0.6.16

The workaround is to instal hgutils in a virtualenv_ ::

  ~/hg.cps-cms.org/hgutils$ virtualenv ~/hg.cps-cms.org/hgutils/virtualenv
  ~/hg.cps-cms.org/hgutils$ source virtualenv/bin/activate

  (virtualenv):~/hg.cps-cms.org/hgutils$ python bootstrap.py
  (virtualenv):~/hg.cps-cms.org/hgutils$ bin/buildout

When the build is done, it's not needed to bother of the virtualenv anymore when
running the executables in hgutils. The virtualenv is only useful for the build
time.

You'll find the produced relocatable scripts in the `bin` subdirectory.
They usually work on the current directory, so you'll have to
put them on your PATH somehow, for example::
 export PATH=~/hg.cps-cms.org/hgutils/bin:$PATH
and you are ready to use the hgutils executables: `hgbundler`, `hgmap`, etc.
