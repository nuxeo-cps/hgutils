HGBUNDLER INSTALL
=================

Dependencies
============

  - lxml (recommended) or elementtree:
    This is in all major linux distributions. Debian example::
         aptitude install python-lxml

  - tidy:
    This is for the pretty dumping of the manifest at the end of the
    release-bundle process. This is in all major linux distributions.
    Debian example::
         aptitude install tidy

  - Pure python dependencies are managed by zc.buildout. Therefore you
    need setuptools/distribute


Installation
============

Buildout sandbox
----------------

Run::

  python bootstrap.py
  bin/buildout

You'll find the produced relocatable scripts in the bin/ subdirectory,
notably hgbundler, strip_reorg.sh

They usually work on the current directory, so you'll have to
put them on your PATH somehow.
