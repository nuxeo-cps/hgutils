HGBUNDLER INSTALL
=================

Dependencies
============

  - lxml (recommended) or elementtree:
    This is in all major linux distributions. Debian example::
         aptitude install python-lxml

  - bundleman:
    Should eventually be relaxed, but still necessary for the release process.
    To get it on *nix, just do, assuming you have distutils::
          easy_install bundleman

  - tidy:
    This is for the pretty dumping of the manifest at the end of the
    release-bundle process. This is in all major linux distributions.
    Debian example::
         aptitude install tidy


Installation
============

There is ironically no packaging yet for hgutils. Simply put ``hgmap``
and ``hgbundler.py`` on the PATH (by copying them into /usr/local/bin
for instance).

This approach works because ``hgbundler.py`` is a single (too long)
module. That won't change unless hgbundler gets a proper packaging, of course.
